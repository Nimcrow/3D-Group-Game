# Description of Current Target for the Game:
- First-person multi-level minigame where there are four levels in which the user can experience different majors. The player can walk into buildings that correspond to an academic program. The goal of the game is to complete all the minigames to ultimately pick your major at the end.

# General Goals for Each Person:

### Abraham Al-Shamsie
- Making the basic player movement where they can walk, run, crouch, jump, and slide. Animating and rigging player’s melee combat, including, punching, kicking, and slashing variations. Implement player’s interactions with objects, like picking up objects, opening doors, hiding in a certain spot, and throwing items. I’ll also try and build a way to transition between levels (scenes) and make a basic main scene to connect the different levels and, potentially, for the player to spawn at (We’re still discussing this part). Implement a basic player stamina, health, and level stats. Maybe if I figure it out in time I’ll try to implement a mini brawl level where the player can experience combat against different bosses from all the majors all at once. Like a huge royal rumble match where everybody is fighting each other in a small area.

### Justin Iwane
- My task is to create a scene revolving around geology majors. I'll design a game where you climb up a hill dodging rocks spawned at the top of the hill. Once you reach a certain point, you'll spawn back at the hub. This will be triggered when the user makes contact with an invisible wall. There will also be a grading system similar to the other scenes. The player starts with a grade of 'A', and that grade goes down a letter each time a user collides with a rock. So if they don't get hit, they'll finish the scene with a grade of an 'A', if they get hit once, they receieve a grade of 'B', and this process repeats till the user reaches 'F'. If they receive an 'F', meaning they get hit 5 times, the user simply restarts the scene. I'll import assets for the hill, and the rock to make the scene a bit more appealing. 

### Bryle Ong
- Design an encounter with a Film Studies major. A minigame reflecting cinematic tropes and film techniques. The player is trapped in a living silent film. Visuals will be black and white film effect, movie props, and objects to dodge (tropes like a falling anvil, slipping on a banana peel, trapdoors). Text box system (following silent movie aesthetic). Film Studies major is the main villain, throwing cartoonish objects which the player has to dodge. Possible extensions to this minigame is moving onto another movie genre after surviving this challenge.

### Christian Dale Ebuen
- Design a dynamic and engaging combat encounter with the "Art Major" enemy, emphasizing creative mechanics that challenge the player's mobility, vision, and strategy. Incorporate unique attacks and defensive tactics, such as screen impairments, stun effects, and environmental hazards, to create a distinctive boss fight experience. Develop thematic assets that reinforce the artistic theme, ensuring the enemy's abilities and visuals align with the environment and player's actions. 

### Huu-Khoa Nguyen
- Create a combat encounter with a "Business Major" enemy. The player will move around a large area trying to dodge an enemy that continuously charges at the player. If the enemy misses and hits a wall the enemy will be stunned for a short amount of time allowing the player to run up and attack the enemy. After a certain amount of HP is lost the enemy will enrage and start to charge more frequently at the player, while maybe shrugging off some of the stuns when hitting the wall. Once the enemy is defeated the level is complete. Will need to find assets mostly just for the enemy as the game is played from the first person perspective. Eventually I want to add power ups that spawn around the map that the player can collect, such as speed boosts, damage amps, or dashes/double jumps.
